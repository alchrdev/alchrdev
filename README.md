# 👋 Hi there! 

## 💻 About Me

I’m a self-taught student of frontend web development. Although I studied a technical career as a software developer and tried creating desktop and mobile applications, I fell in love with frontend web development.

Why? Because it brings together all the things I love, including user interfaces and user experiences. And in general, it’s an art form. That’s what programming means to me.

The stack I chose includes Node JS, React, and React Native, either because the job market demands it, to challenge myself, or simply to satisfy my curiosity. I’m aware that there’s still a lot to learn, and technology is always changing. But even with all that, I want to keep trying. And maybe, someday, I’ll be able to laugh at those who didn’t believe I could do it or who thought I was just “wasting time on the computer.”
